## 🎯 Objective

**Build a Usable and pleasant web page that interacts with arrays, objects, functions etc... with JavaScript, HTML and CSS.**

## 🏗 Prerequisites

1. Be sure **to have a clean working copy**.

This means that you should not have any uncommitted local changes.

```sh
❯ cd /path/to/workspace/clear-fashion
❯ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

2. **Pull** the `master` branch to update your local with the new remote changes

```sh
❯ git remote add upstream git@github.com:92bondstreet/clear-fashion.git
## or ❯ git remote add upstream https://github.com/92bondstreet/clear-fashion
❯ git fetch upstream
❯ git pull upstream master
```

4. **Open the entry point [../client/index.html](../client/index.html)** in your browser (that loads the [../client/portfolio.js](../client/portfolio.js) file)

```sh
# macos cli
❯ open client/index.html
# linux cli
❯ xdg-open client/index.html

# or by double-clicking in your browser files
```

5. **Check the rendering of your browser webpage**

## 📱 Features

I will describe each feature with the [Agile User Story template](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/user-story-template/).

A [User Story](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/project-management/user-stories) is an informal, general explanation of a software feature written from the perspective of the end user or customer.

A user story should typically have a summary structured this way:

1. **As a** [user concerned by the story]
1. **I want** [goal of the story]
1. **so that** [reason for the story]

## 👩‍💻 Just tell me what to do

1. **Solve each `User Stories`** inside [../client/portfolio.js](../client/portfolio.js) file with JavaScript

<img src="./img/2-portfolio.png" width="75%"/>


2. Once an User Story is solved, **commit your modification**:

```sh
❯ cd /path/to/workspace/clear-fashion
❯ git add -A && git commit -m "feat(display): show 12, 24 or 48 products"
```

([why following a commit message convention?](https://dev.to/chrissiemhrk/git-commit-message-5e21)

3. **Commit early, commit often**
4. Don't forget **to push before the end of the workshop**

```sh
❯ git push origin master
```

**Note**: if you catch an error about authentication, [add your ssh to your github profile](https://help.github.com/articles/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/).

10. Check that your codebase works by checking the console output
11. If you need some helps on git commands, read [git - the simple guide](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/)

### Don't forget. 4 Focus.

* DOT - Do One Thing
* LIM - Less Is More
* If you change the [../client/index.html](../client/index.html) selectors, you should probably update [../client/portfolio.js](../client/portfolio.js) file
* English only: codebase, variables, comments...

**Focus on coding and web design**
